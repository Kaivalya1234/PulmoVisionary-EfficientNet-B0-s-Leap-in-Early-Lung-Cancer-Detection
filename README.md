# PulmoVisionary-EfficientNet-B0-s-Leap-in-Early-Lung-Cancer-Detection




# Abstract
Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection significantly improves patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention. This study introduces PulmoVisionary, an advanced lung cancer detection framework leveraging the EfficientNet B0 deep learning model. By analyzing CT scan images from the IQ-OTH/NCCD Lung Cancer Dataset, the model classifies lung conditions into normal, benign, or malignant categories. The dataset comprises 1190 CT scan images, representing 110 cases. The hybrid architecture of the proposed model integrates convolutional layers, max-pooling, and fully connected layers, achieving superior performance in feature extraction and classification. Preprocessing techniques such as image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation enhance model generalization and accuracy. With a remarkable accuracy of 98.96%, sensitivity of 98.89%, and specificity of 97.07%, this framework demonstrates significant potential to assist radiologists and oncologists in early lung cancer diagnosis. The proposed solution presents a scalable, efficient, and reliable tool for medical image analysis, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and survival rates.
